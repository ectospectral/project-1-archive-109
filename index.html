        <p>"My Avatar" is an original character design 3D model that was built, sculpted, and painted using Blender and Adobe's 3D Substance Painter. 
            This piece touches on the topic about holding onto childhood and the things that heal the inner child within you. 
            One thing that I tend to still gravitate towards are the little trinkets and toys that contain the sole purpose of accompanying you. 
            Family and friends ridicule me for collecting these as "you are too old to be buying them" yet they bring me an abundance of joy. 
            Should you have to sacrifice your happiness at the mere judgment of another? Image may also be included here</p>
        <h4>"For Shits and Giggles"</h4>
        <p>"For Shits and Giggles" is a wire sculpture that highlights the critique of art in a broad sense.
            Art doesn't always need to discuss upon the conversations about seriousness and real world issues. 
            Art can be a plain result of pure joy or even of the mundane day-to-day life. 
            Many of us are just average people, what if we recreated average objects? Image may also be included here</p>
        <h4>"Bite Me"</h4>
        <p>"Bite Me" is a ceramic glazed sculpture of a bao bun and a steamer that touches on the topic of culture.
            Ever since I can remember, I was taunted at school about the food that I brought or the ways in which I enjoy my cultural practices.
            This piece pays homage to my childhood comfort foods highlighting the importance of food in asian culture. image may also be included here</p>
